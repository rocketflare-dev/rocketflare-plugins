/**
 * Cut a release — the mechanical half, so `scripts/release-check.mjs` passes by construction.
 *
 *   node scripts/release.mjs <X.Y.Z> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry-run] [--skip-plugin-check]
 *
 * Folds `docs/upgrades/unreleased.md` into `docs/upgrades/X.Y.Z.md`, fills its `version`,
 * `previous` and `date`, bumps every version file, prepends a `CHANGELOG.md` section, and writes a
 * fresh empty `unreleased.md`.
 *
 * Then: commit, `git tag X.Y.Z && git push origin X.Y.Z` (docs/DEPLOY.md, "The release dance").
 *
 * **Two kinds of repository run this** (D31). The kit stamps the root `package.json` and
 * `.rocketflare.json`'s `kit.version`; a PLUGIN repository — a checkout with a
 * `rocketflare-plugin.json` and no `.rocketflare.json` — stamps every plugin manifest in it and its
 * `package.json` if it has one. Everything else is identical, because a plugin's releases are read
 * by exactly the same machinery: `previous` chains, the four headings, and `pnpm plugin upgrade`
 * walking the notes between two commits. `releaseContext()` is the whole of the difference.
 *
 * `--plugin <subdir>` (repeatable) resolves that context INSIDE a subdirectory, which is the whole
 * of what a plugin MONOREPO needs: `rocketflare-plugins` holds `plugins/<id>/rocketflare-plugin.json`
 * and nothing at the root, so without it `releaseContext()` answers `unknown` and this exits 1.
 * Every plugin in such a repository ships at ONE version and is tagged plain `X.Y.Z`, with no
 * prefix and no per-plugin namespacing — a tag has to stay resolvable by `ls-remote <repo> <ref>`,
 * which cannot resolve a bare SHA, and `latestTag()` is how `--to` and `openSource` default. The
 * accepted cost of that lockstep: a fix to one plugin bumps every plugin's version.
 *
 * In the KIT it additionally refuses a version its `defaultPlugins` are not ready for (D31,
 * decision 5): every entry must still resolve at the ref the kit pins, and a declared
 * `requires.kit` range must admit the version being cut. `--skip-plugin-check` is the escape
 * hatch, and it says so loudly.
 *
 * Exit 0 ok · 1 error · 2 usage.

 * **The MIRROR is what answers the second half**, and it has to: `git ls-remote` proves a ref
 * exists but cannot read a file out of it, so before this the range came only from an INSTALLED
 * surface — and the kit does not install its own default plugins. `pnpm kit:release 0.7.0` was
 * therefore refused every single time with "cannot read its requires.kit range", making
 * `--skip-plugin-check` mandatory rather than the loud escape hatch it was written as, which is
 * the same as having no check at all.
 *
 * So: fetch the plugin at its pinned ref into the same blobless mirror `pnpm plugin` already keeps
 * (one clone, cached under `.upgrade/plugins/`), and read `rocketflare-plugin.json` out of it. That
 * is the plugin's own statement AT THE PIN, which is strictly better than an installed surface's
 * record of whatever was true when somebody last installed it.
 *
 * Three fallbacks, each deliberate:
 *
 *   - the mirror cannot be opened (offline, no access) → `ls-remote` proves the ref, and the range
 *     falls back to the installed surface, or to null, which the caller still reports;
 *   - the ref resolves but carries no manifest → the surface's record, rather than a refusal: an
 *     older plugin release may predate the file;
 *   - the manifest is there but is not JSON → a refusal, because that is a broken plugin rather
 *     than a missing answer.
 *
 * `openMirror` and `lsRemote` are injected so the test can drive every branch without a network.
