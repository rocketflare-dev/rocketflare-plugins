 * What a step COSTS somebody, and why "by hand" is retired as a phrase.
 *
 * It answers neither of the two questions that matter to whatever performs the step, and installs
 * are performed by AGENTS as often as by people now. Prose an agent may skim is not a control —
 * that is precisely how `workerExports` and `coreEdits` each produced a tree that built and then
 * failed somewhere else entirely. So every remaining step declares which of three it is:
 *
 *   - `declarative` — nobody does it; the tooling does. These do not appear at all. Everything
 *     Parts 1 and 2 moved (the barrel lines, bindings, crons, prefixes, vars, the DO migration
 *     tag) left this list by BECOMING declarative, which is the only honest way to shorten it.
 *   - `agent`       — an instruction PLUS a check that proves it was done. Without the check it is
 *     a sentence, and a sentence is the thing being replaced.
 *   - `human`       — a DECISION: a secret's value, a migration that drops something, retiring a
 *     Durable Object namespace, deleting a live resource. Not automatable in PRINCIPLE rather than
 *     merely unimplemented — that distinction is what stops this list collecting excuses.
 *
 * Every step carries the exact `command`, the observable `expect` and the `assert` that proves it,
 * so `--json` can make a human step structurally unmissable rather than a sentence in a paragraph.
