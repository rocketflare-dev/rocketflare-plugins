/**
 * The pure half of `scripts/upgrade.mjs`: path classification against `.rocketflare.json`, the
 * diff translator, and the release-note parser. No I/O and nothing runs at import time, so
 * `apps/web/tests/config/upgrade-lib.test.ts` can drive it under vitest; `upgrade-lib.d.mts`
 * beside this file is the hand-written type surface (no `allowJs`).
 *
 * The problem this solves: an adopted copy of the kit has been renamed (`scripts/rename.mjs`
 * rewrote `@rocketflare/` to `@myapp/` in every file) and pruned (`docs/ADAPTING.md` §2 told the
 * adopter to delete the example agents, cubes and CLI commands). A raw kit diff therefore matches
 * nothing and, worse, would recreate what they deleted. So before anything is applied:
 *
 *   1. every file block of the diff is classified — the manifest says which surface a path belongs
 *      to, and a surface whose ANCHOR FILE is absent locally is dropped entirely;
 *   2. the surviving blocks are translated through the SAME token map the rename used, so the
 *      patch arrives already speaking the adopter's names.
 *
 * Two invariants make (2) safe and are asserted by the test:
 *
 *   - every replacement is single-line, so `@@ -a,b +c,d @@` line counts are untouched (columns
 *     move, lines do not). `deriveNames` refusing a newline in the display name is what holds it.
 *   - `index <sha>..<sha>` lines are STRIPPED. They name kit blobs that describe nothing once the
 *     content is translated, and their absence makes `git apply --3way` fail loudly rather than
 *     silently merge against the wrong preimage.

/**
 * Does `version` satisfy `range`, and — when that cannot be answered — why not?
 *
 * A deliberately tiny semver matcher (D31): `plugin.json` declares `requires.kit` as a range, and
 * the kit ships no dependency to evaluate one with.
 *
 * Supported: `>=x.y.z`, `>x.y.z`, `<=x.y.z`, `<x.y.z`, `=x.y.z`, a bare `x.y.z` (exact), `^x.y.z`,
 * `~x.y.z`, `*` / `''` (anything), a space-separated CONJUNCTION of any of those
 * (`>=0.5.0 <1.0.0`), a `||` ALTERNATION of conjunctions (`^0.6.0 || ^0.7.0`), and **a space after
 * the operator** (`>= 0.5.0`). Those last two are ordinary semver spellings that anyone writing a
 * `requires.kit` by hand reaches for without thinking, and refusing them taught nobody anything.
 * Still NOT supported: hyphen ranges, `x`/`*` placeholders inside a version, and pre-release tags —
 * the kit's own versions are `X.Y.Z` (`VERSION_RE`), so anything else is REPORTED rather than
 * approximated.
 *
 * **Reported, not thrown.** This used to throw on a range it could not read, and the throw
 * travelled out of `pnpm plugin add` as a generic error with exit 1 — while the documented answer
 * for "a requirement is unmet" is exit 6. So the primitive returns `{ ok, problem }`: `problem` is
 * the sentence to show, and each caller folds it into its own problem list, which is what maps it
 * to the right exit code.
 *
 * `^` follows npm exactly, including the zero-major rule that catches people out: `^0.5.0` is
 * `>=0.5.0 <0.6.0`, NOT `<1.0.0` — a 0.x minor bump may break anything. `~0.5.0` is `>=0.5.0
 * <0.6.0` too; they only differ once the major is non-zero.

 * Why this version must NOT be released — one sentence per problem, empty when it may be.

 * `rocketflare-plugin.json`). It returns `{ ok, reason?, requiresKit?, version? }`.
 *
 * What this proves and what it does not, stated plainly because the difference matters: it proves
 * every default plugin is still FETCHABLE at the ref the kit pins and that its declared
 * `requires.kit` range admits the version being cut. It does not prove that plugin's tests pass
 * against it — nothing a release script can do proves that. The kit's own CI installs every default
 * plugin and runs the full gate on the release commit (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and each plugin
 * repository runs the mirrored check against the kit (`.github/workflows/plugin-ci.yml`). Those two
 * are the compatibility proof; this is the stop that catches a pin nobody updated.
 *
 * A VENDORED entry (the kit's own repository, no subdirectory) is exempt from the range check for
 * the reason §16 gives: the same release cut both, so the range describes the kit it shipped inside
 * rather than a compatibility claim.
