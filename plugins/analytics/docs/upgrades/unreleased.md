## What changed

Analytics now ships four Claude Code skills for drizzle-cube: `analytics`, `analytics-cubes`, `analytics-queries` and `analytics-dashboards`.

- `analytics` is the entry point: what the plugin gives you, who can do what, a health check, and routing to the other three. It also mentions drizzle-cube's own Claude Code plugin as an optional complement.
- `analytics-cubes` covers defining and extending cubes with drizzle-cube 0.8.3's API (with a `reference.md`), fact tables, contributing a cube from another plugin, and the mandatory isolation test.
- `analytics-queries` covers querying via `/cubejs-api/v1`, and connecting Claude Code or Claude Desktop (through `mcp-remote`) to `/mcp` with an API key.
- `analytics-dashboards` covers dashboards, group visibility, templates and the `/api/analytics` routes.
- Adapted from `cliftonc/drizzle-cube-plugin` (MIT), with its cube syntax corrected for the pinned version.
- `minKit` rises from 0.8.0 to 0.13.0, the first kit that installs plugin skills. A copy on an older kit stays on analytics 3.2.0 until it upgrades the kit.

## How to apply

1. Upgrade the kit to 0.13.0 or later first (`pnpm kit:upgrade`).
2. Run `pnpm plugin upgrade analytics --apply`. It installs the four directories under `.claude/skills/` and changes no code.

## Conflicts to expect

None, unless the app already has its own `.claude/skills/analytics*` directory, which the install refuses. Rename yours first.

## Verify

1. `pnpm plugin check` reports `analytics` checks out, and `.claude/skills/analytics-cubes/SKILL.md` exists.
