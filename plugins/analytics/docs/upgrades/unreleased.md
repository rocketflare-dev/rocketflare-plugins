## What changed

The cube API passes the request's database handle to drizzle-cube in a form that type-checks against kit 0.15.0, whose `Database` is driver-neutral; without it an app with analytics fails `pnpm typecheck` after taking that kit.

- `api/routes/cube-api.ts` hands `ctx.db` to `createCubeApp` as drizzle-cube's own `DrizzleDatabase` type. Kit 0.15.0 types `Database` as drizzle's `PgDatabase` base so a raw `execute()` is `unknown` (postgres.js resolves an array, the Neon driver `{ rows }`); drizzle-cube declares `unknown[]` but normalises both shapes at runtime, so nothing about the queries changes.
- Proven under both drivers against kit 0.15.0: every analytics api test, including `cube-isolation.test.ts` and `fact-table-refresh.test.ts`, passes with `DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres` and `DATABASE_DRIVER=neon`.
- `minKit` stays 0.13.0: the cast compiles against 0.13 and 0.14 as well.

## How to apply

1. Run `pnpm plugin upgrade analytics --apply`. It changes one property and a comment in `api/routes/cube-api.ts`. No schema change and no migration.

## Conflicts to expect

Only if you edited the `createCubeApp({ … })` call in `cube-api.ts`: keep your change and pass `drizzle: ctx.db as unknown as DrizzleDatabase` (type import from `drizzle-cube/server`).

## Verify

1. `pnpm typecheck` passes.
2. `pnpm test` passes, including `src/plugins/analytics/tests/api/cube-isolation.test.ts`.
