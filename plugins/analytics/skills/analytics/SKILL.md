# Analytics — orientation, health check and routing

The `analytics` plugin adds a **semantic layer** to this app. It is built on
[drizzle-cube](https://www.drizzle-cube.dev), pinned at **0.8.3**. It gives you:

- **Cubes**: named, tenant-scoped definitions of measures (counts, sums, distinct counts) and
  dimensions (role, event type, dates) over the app's own Postgres tables.
- **An API over the cubes**: `/cubejs-api/v1/{load,meta,sql,dry-run,explain,batch}` (Cube.js-compatible)
  and an **MCP endpoint** at `/mcp`, both behind the app's normal sign-in or API key.
- **Dashboards**: one row per dashboard in `analytics_pages`, rendered by drizzle-cube's React
  components at `/analytics` (list), `/analytics/:pageId` (view and edit) and `/analytics/explore`
  (query builder). They can be restricted to groups (D29).
- **Fact tables**: pre-aggregated tables rebuilt every hour at `:15` by a cron. One example ships:
  `analytics_tenant_activity_daily_facts`.
- **CLI**: `rocketflare analytics pages list | check-facts | refresh-facts`.

The code lives in `apps/web/src/plugins/analytics/`. Its `CLAUDE.md` and the `CLAUDE.md` files in
its folders are the reference; this skill and its siblings are the how-to.

## Route to the right skill

| The person wants to… | Use |
|---|---|
| add or change a metric, add a cube over a new table, add a fact table, contribute a cube from another plugin | **`analytics-cubes`** |
| ask a question of the data, call the API from a script, debug a query, connect Claude Code / Claude Desktop to `/mcp` | **`analytics-queries`** |
| create, edit, share, restrict, reset or template a dashboard | **`analytics-dashboards`** |
| understand what is there, or check it works | stay here: **Explain** or **Health** below |

## Explain (no changes)

1. Say what the plugin is (above) in two sentences, then list the cubes it serves today:
   - `Users`: people in this organisation, scoped through membership.
   - `TenantUsers` (title "Members"): memberships with role and join date, plus owner, admin and
     member counts.
   - `ActivityEvents`: the audit log, one row per event. It is an event stream, so funnels, flows
     and retention work on it.
   - `TenantActivityDaily` (title "Daily Activity"): the fact-table cube (events and active users
     per day).

   Plus any cube another installed plugin contributed. Read `apps/web/src/plugins/analytics/cubes/index.ts`
   and `pnpm plugin list` to see which plugins are installed.
2. **Who can do what** (grants in `apps/web/src/plugins/analytics/index.ts`):
   - Everyone in the organisation (owner, admin, support, member) may read dashboards and query
     cubes.
   - Owner, admin and support may create, edit, share, reset and delete dashboards.
   - Only owners and admins may see fact-table status and trigger a rebuild.
3. **The safety rule to state every time cubes come up:** every cube filters its own rows by
   tenant, and nothing else does. drizzle-cube adds no second line of defence. A cube without the
   tenant filter would show every organisation's rows to every member. That is why the isolation
   test is mandatory; `analytics-cubes` covers it.

## Health (read-only)

Run these in order and stop at the first failure. You need the app running (`pnpm dev`) and the
CLI signed in (`pnpm cli login --server http://localhost:3001`). Use `pnpm cli …` inside the repo,
or `rocketflare …` if the CLI is installed globally.

1. **Installed?** `pnpm plugin list` should list `analytics`. If it doesn't:
   `pnpm plugin add https://github.com/rocketflare-dev/rocketflare-plugins.git --subdir plugins/analytics`
   shows the plan; add `--apply` once the person agrees. The kit's `defaultPlugins` installs it
   during `pnpm bootstrap`, so a fresh clone normally has it.
2. **Well formed?** `pnpm plugin check` should print `analytics` in its "check out" line.
3. **Migrated?** `pnpm db:migrate` exits 0. A missing `analytics_pages` table means the host never
   generated the plugin's migration, so run `pnpm db:generate --name plugin-analytics-<version>` then
   `pnpm db:migrate`.
4. **Dashboards reachable?** `pnpm cli analytics pages list` prints a table with at least
   "Tenant Overview". The first list for an organisation creates its template dashboards, so an
   empty table on the very first call is normal; run it again.
5. **Cubes reachable?** Open `http://localhost:3000/analytics/explore`. The field picker lists the
   cubes above. From a terminal, `analytics-queries` shows a `curl` against `/cubejs-api/v1/meta`.
6. **Facts fresh?** (admin or owner) Run `pnpm cli analytics check-facts`. It exits 1 and says
   `STALE` if a table's lag is more than twice its refresh interval. Fix it with
   `pnpm cli analytics refresh-facts`, which enqueues a rebuild of this organisation's facts. Under
   `wrangler dev` the queue consumer runs in-process, so it finishes within seconds.

**What "healthy" looks like:** all six pass. Report the result as a short checklist.

**Common failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/cubejs-api/...` or `/mcp` returns the app's HTML | the paths aren't in `[assets] run_worker_first`, or aren't proxied by Vite in dev | `pnpm plugin add` printed these host edits: add `/cubejs-api`, `/cubejs-api/*`, `/mcp` and `/mcp/*` to `run_worker_first` in both wrangler tomls (or run `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>`), and add both prefixes to the dev proxy in `apps/web/vite.config.ts`. The config tests fail until you do |
| facts never refresh when deployed | the `15 * * * *` cron isn't in `[triggers]` of both tomls | add it, or run `pnpm provision cloudflare <env>` |
| 401 on every cube call | not signed in, or the API key is wrong or revoked | `pnpm cli whoami`; create a new key |
| 403 `no_tenant` | the session has no organisation selected | pick one at `/select-tenant` |
| the build fails on `@nivo/heatmap` | the Vite alias to `ui/lib/nivo-heatmap.tsx` is missing | re-add the alias from the install plan |

## Optional complement: the upstream drizzle-cube Claude Code plugin

drizzle-cube's author publishes a general Claude Code plugin with slash commands (`/dc-query`,
`/dc-debug`, `/dc-create-cube` …), generic drizzle-cube skills and an MCP bridge. It is **not
needed**: these skills cover the same ground for this app's version and conventions. It is useful
for its REST tools (SQL preview, explain plans). Install it from inside a Claude Code session:

```text
/plugin marketplace add cliftonc/drizzle-cube-plugin
/plugin install drizzle-cube@drizzle-cube-marketplace
```

The repository registers its marketplace as `drizzle-cube-marketplace`, with one plugin called
`drizzle-cube`. The project README shows an older one-line form; the two commands above follow
Claude Code's current plugin docs. To point it at this app, create `.drizzle-cube.json` in the
project root:

```json
{ "serverUrl": "http://localhost:3001", "apiToken": "<a Rocketflare API key>" }
```

Or set the environment variables `DRIZZLE_CUBE_SERVER_URL` and `DRIZZLE_CUBE_API_TOKEN`. It sends
the token as `Authorization: Bearer …`, which is exactly what this app accepts. **Warn the person
about two things:**
- Its generic skills show an older cube syntax that does not compile on drizzle-cube 0.8.3
  (`analytics-cubes` explains the difference). Prefer this plugin's skills when writing code here.
- `.drizzle-cube.json` holds a credential, so add it to `.gitignore`.
