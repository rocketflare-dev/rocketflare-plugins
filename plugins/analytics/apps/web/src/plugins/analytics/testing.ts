/**
 * The shape a cube-isolation case takes (D31 decision 6), declared here rather than in the test so

 * **A cube is not done until it has a case.** drizzle-cube adds no second line of defence — an
 * unscoped cube hands every tenant's rows to every member — so the coverage assertion in
 * `tests/api/cube-isolation.test.ts` compares the case keys to the whole registry, this plugin's
 * cubes and every contributed one together. A contributed cube with no case fails the host's suite.
