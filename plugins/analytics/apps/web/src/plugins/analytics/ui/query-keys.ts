/**
 * The plugin's TanStack query families (D31), declared once here and handed to the host twice: to
 * `UiPlugin.queryKeys`, which merges them into the app-wide `queryKeys` so anything may reach them,
 * and to this plugin's own hooks, which read them directly.
 *
 * **Every root starts with `<id>:`** — `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` is the check — so one
 * plugin's invalidation can never reach another's cache, and `ANALYTICS_DASHBOARDS_ENTITY` is the
 * same string the server puts in its `entity.changed` nudge and in `SharedPlugin.realtimeRoots`,
 * which is what makes the socket wiring free.
 *
 * One family, not four: pages, templates, the fact-table status and the cube meta all invalidate
 * together when somebody's access moves (D29), and a create/reset/recreate has to reach the list
 * and every open detail at once.
