/**
 * Build-time stand-in for `@nivo/heatmap` (D19). drizzle-cube's heat-map chart chunk imports
 * `ResponsiveHeatMap` by name from this optional peer; the kit does not ship @nivo (recharts is
 * the one chart library), and Rollup refuses a named import from Vite's
 * optional-peer placeholder. `vite.config.ts` aliases the package here so the lazily loaded
 * chart chunk still builds; picking the heat-map chart type renders this notice instead of a
 * chart. Install `@nivo/heatmap` and delete the alias to enable it.
