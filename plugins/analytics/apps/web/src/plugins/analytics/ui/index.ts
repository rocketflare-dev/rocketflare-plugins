/**
 * `analytics` — the plugin's UI entry (D31, Phase C).
 *
 * **This file ships in the MAIN bundle**, because `App.tsx`, `SideNav` and `Home` import the barrel
 * that imports it, for every reader — including the ones who never open a dashboard. So it wires
 * things up and nothing else: every page arrives as `lazy(() => import(...))`, which is what keeps
 * drizzle-cube, recharts, d3 and react-grid-layout out of the shell and inside the analytics chunk
 * (`tests/config/plugins.test.ts` reads this file's SOURCE and enforces both halves).
 *
 * The nav item, the Home quick link and all three routes share ONE guard object, so a link can
 * never point at a page its reader cannot open. `read Analytics` is every member's (§8): pages are
 * tenant-shared and row scoping is inside every cube; editing is gated per control by
 * `manage Dashboard`.
