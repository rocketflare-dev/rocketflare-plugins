/**
 * The two subjects this plugin adds to the kit's ability matrix (D10, D31).
 *
 * They were rows in the kit's `tests/config/permissions.test.ts` until analytics left the kit; the
 * kit's matrix lost them and this file gained them, which is the rule in one line — a plugin tests
 * its own behaviour, and the host tests that it is a well-formed plugin.
 *
 * **It is an `api` test rather than a `config` one now, and the reason is the contract.** It used
 * to call `buildAbility` from `@/permissions/abilities` directly; the plugin surface does not
 * publish it, and the declared way to ask "what may this role do" is `makeRequestCtx(...).can(...)`
 * from `@testkit/unit`, which runs the REAL `buildAbility` — including the plugin grants merged
 * into it. Every context builder requires a handle the integration harness handed out, so the file
 * moves to where the database is. The answers it asserts are unchanged.
 *
 * `Dashboard` is an `analytics_pages` row: admin-level roles manage it, a member reads it, and "is
 * this page yours" is never a CASL condition — the route ANDs `visibleAnalyticsPages(scope)` onto
 * the tenant predicate (D29). `Analytics` is the cube API itself, which is read-only by nature and
 * open to every member because every cube scopes its own `sql()` by tenant.
