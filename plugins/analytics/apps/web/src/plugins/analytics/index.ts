/**
 * `analytics` — the analytics plugin's SERVER entry (D31, Phase C).
 *
 * One of the four published files a plugin has (this, `./ui`, the shared entry and the CLI one);
 * everything else under this directory is private, which is what lets the plugin's own semver
 * cover a knowable surface. `tests/config/plugins.test.ts` enforces it: nothing outside the plugin
 * may name a file inside it except the five barrel lines.
 *
 * Read this file top to bottom and you have the whole server half: three mounts and the two extra
 * prefixes they need, the fact-refresh job, the hourly cron, the two CASL subjects with their
 * grants, dashboards as a restrictable resource, and what a new organisation and the demo seed get.
 *
 * **It is also the boundary.** The registration slots below are the KIT's shapes — a `JobHandler`,
 * a `ScheduledTask`, the hook signatures — while everything the plugin's own code is written
 * against is the plugin surface. So the adapters (`jobCtx`, `cronCtx`, and the two hook spreads)
 * are called here, once each, and nowhere else. That is the sentence the whole contract makes
 * true: *a plugin imports only from declared entries, and receives everything else as injected
 * context.*
 *
 * **Everything here was core until 0.6.0.** `Dashboard` and `Analytics` left `CORE_SUBJECTS` and
 * the kit's ability matrix; `/cubejs-api` and `/mcp` left `CORE_API_PREFIXES`; the `15 * * * *`
 * entry left `CORE_SCHEDULED_TASKS` and both tomls' `[triggers]`; `ensureDefaultDashboards` left
 * `onTenantCreated`; the dashboards entry left `CORE_VISIBILITY_RESOURCES`. The kit is bare, and
 * this file is what puts analytics back.
