/**
 * `analytics.refresh-facts` — rebuild ONE organisation's fact tables (D31).
 *
 * This exists because a route never runs long work and a fact rebuild is a full DELETE+INSERT per
 * table. `POST /api/analytics/facts/refresh` (and `rocketflare analytics refresh-facts` over it)
 * enqueues; this handler does it. The `:15` cron is still the normal path — this is the "I have
 * just changed something and want the numbers now" path that `pnpm web db:refresh-facts` used to
 * be before analytics left the kit and its scripts with it.
 *
 * **One tenant, always.** The payload carries the tenant the route resolved from the caller's auth
 * context; a job a tenant API key can enqueue must never rebuild somebody else's rows. The
 * cross-tenant rebuild is the cron, which has no request behind it — and it is why `JobCtx`
 * carries no `tenantId` of its own: a job's tenant comes from its PAYLOAD.
 *
 * Handler contract: everything is awaited, there is no `waitUntil` in a consumer (which is why
 * `JobCtx` has no `defer`, where `RequestCtx` does), a throw is retried with backoff and a return
 * is an `ack`. `jobCtx` adapts the kit's context once, at the registration boundary below.
