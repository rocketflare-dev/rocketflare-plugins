/**
 * Cube registry (D19, D31): `allCubes()` is what `api/routes/cube-api.ts` hands to `createCubeApp`
 * on every request and what `tests/api/cube-isolation.test.ts` walks. Adding a cube = a file here +
 * an entry below + a case in that test. Another PLUGIN adds one through
 * `analyticsExtensions({ cubes, cubeIsolationCases })` (D31 decision 6). Read ./CLAUDE.md first.
 *
 * **Every cube is a memoised FACTORY rather than a module-scope const**, because three of them name
 * kit tables (`activity_events`, `tenant_users`) that `@/db/schema/kit` does not carry and which
 * therefore arrive through `kitTables()` — a call that must not happen at module scope. Built once
 * per isolate on first use; the join thunks (`targetCube: () => usersCube()`) were already lazy, so
 * nothing about the cube definitions changed.
