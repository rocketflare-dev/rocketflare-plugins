/**
 * The SELECT that builds `analytics_tenant_activity_daily_facts` for ONE tenant (D19): `activity_events`
 * grouped by UTC day and actor. Column ORDER must match the fact table's declaration order —
 * `refresh.ts` names the INSERT's target columns from `getTableColumns`, so a drift fails loudly
 * ("INSERT has more target columns than expressions") instead of shifting values silently.
 * Parameterised (`${tenantId}` is a bound value), never string-interpolated.
 *
 * EXAMPLE (surface `example-cube-tenant-activity-daily`): deletable with its fact table and cube.
