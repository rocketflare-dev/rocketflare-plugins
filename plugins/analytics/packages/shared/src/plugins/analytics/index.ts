/**
 * `analytics` — the analytics plugin's SHARED entry (D31, Phase C).
 *
 * One of the four published files a plugin has (this, the server entry, `ui/index.ts` and the CLI
 * one); everything else under `packages/shared/src/plugins/analytics/` is private, which is what
 * lets the plugin's own semver cover a knowable surface. Imported as
 * `@rocketflare/shared/plugins/analytics/index` — the package's `./*` export maps to a FILE, so the
 * `/index` is load-bearing and is not a typo.
 *
 * It carries the contracts `./contracts.ts` used to hold at `@rocketflare/shared/plugins/analytics/index` when
 * analytics was part of the kit, plus the four slots the seam needs from the shared half:
 *
 *   subjects        `Dashboard` (an `analytics_pages` row) and `Analytics` (the cube API itself),
 *                   which leave the kit's `CORE_SUBJECTS` with this plugin.
 *   jobs            `analytics.refresh-facts` — what `rocketflare analytics refresh-facts` and
 *                   `POST /api/analytics/facts/refresh` enqueue, because a route never runs long
 *                   work and a fact rebuild is a full DELETE+INSERT per table.
 *   realtimeRoots   the dashboards query-key root, added to `access.changed` so somebody whose
 *                   group membership moved re-fetches the pages they may now no longer open (D29).
 *
 * **This module never imports a composer at runtime** (`permissions.ts`, `features.ts`, `jobs.ts`,
 * `ai/agents.ts`, `realtime.ts`): those five read the plugin barrel, so importing one back closes a
 * cycle that crashes at module evaluation rather than failing to compile.
